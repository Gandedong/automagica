Automagica
======================================

Automagica is an open source (robotic) process automation platform. 
With Automagica, automating cross-platform processes becomes a breeze. 
With this open source library we want to provide:
- a comprehensive and consistent wrapper around known and lesser known automation libraries
- implement best practices for robust automation
- provide tools to automate legacy GUI applications, but also modern applications
