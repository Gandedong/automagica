# Automagica Lab
## Introduction
The Automagica Lab allows you to build software bots from an interactive development environment (IDE) based on Jupyter Notebooks. Those familiar with Jupyter Notebooks and Python will feel right at home with the Automagica Lab.

## Getting started
After installing Automagica, you can launch the Automagica Lab with the following command:
```bash
automagica lab new
```
If you'd like to edit an existing Automagica Lab file (ending with `.ipynb`), run the following command:
```bash
automagica lab edit examples/automagica_lab_example.ipynb
```
