# Automagica Flow

Automagica Flow allows you to build software robots with a visual interface. Automagica Flow is the best and easiest way to get started building software automations. 

## Get started
You can get started with Automagica Flow either by:
- double-clicking the shortcut on your desktop after installation (Windows One-Click installer)
- by running the `automagica flow new` command in the command line
- if you have Automagica installed on this machine through our one-click installer, you can also start Automagica Flow by clicking [here](automagica://flow/new)
